"""
Kiro API error enhancement and user-friendly message formatting.

This module provides a centralized system for enhancing cryptic Kiro API errors
with clear, actionable, user-friendly messages.

Architecture:
- KiroErrorReason: Enum of known error reasons from Kiro API
- KiroErrorInfo: Structured information about an enhanced error
- enhance_kiro_error(): Analyzes error JSON and returns enhanced message

Example:
    >>> error_json = {"message": "Input is too long.", "reason": "CONTENT_LENGTH_EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD"}
    >>> error_info = enhance_kiro_error(error_json)
    >>> print(error_info.user_message)
    "Model context limit reached. Conversation size exceeds model capacity."
